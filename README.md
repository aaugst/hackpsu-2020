## PREOCCUPY
created by **Andreya Augst** and **Rishi Garg**

Our web app responds to the increased depression, loneliness, and boredom reported by youth and young adults due to the onset of COVID-19. _PREOCCUPY_ creates a space to cure boredom and improve your mood by suggesting activities to try based on your mood. Users with high mood levels will be suggested more "fun" activities, while users with lower mood levels will be suggested more self-care activities to help improve their mood. The web app includes a profile page to track your mood and accomplishments over time, and a chat feature to talk anonymously with other users. 

We used Figma, HTML/CSS, Adobe Illustrator and Bootstrap Studio to design the front-end of the site.

We used Python, Github, something else for the back-end of the site.

"preoccupy: verb (T); to be the main thought in someone's mind, causing other things to be forgotten" (Definition of _preoccupy_ from the Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary & Thesaurus Â© Cambridge University Press).
